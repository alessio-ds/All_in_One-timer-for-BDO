It collects data from mmotimer.com, and then computes the countdown on its own.
It will save your server preferences, but if you wish to change the server to look for just delete the `preferred_server.txt` file.

# How to install:

### **Python**:
You will need to install the [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/ "requests") library, by typing in your console:

`pip install requests`



### **Windows**:
**Download the latest build [here](https://github.com/alessio-ds/All_in_One-timer-for-BDO/raw/main/AIO-Timer.exe)**

I compiled it with [autopytoexe](https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/).
It will take some time to load (about 5 seconds).

**Warning!**

When you download the .exe, your browser might detect it as a virus. It usually happens with programs that have got too few downloads.
The [VirusTotal Scan](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/2c3bdc41b30eefce8abb6f27264f18c3731686317f1dc2c9d7a91e1736bd0048/detection) shows that it's not harmful, at best it gets detected as a "Heuristic threat".
In any case, remember that you can always use the Python file, as it is opensource and you can just look at it.
